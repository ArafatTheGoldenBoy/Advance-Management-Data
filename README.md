# PizzaPadler
PizzaPadler is a web-based project that functions similarly to a pizza management system, allowing users to select a pizza with a variety of ingredients and place orders with a pizza bakery. The pizza baker oversees ingredients, suppliers, and pies.<br>
To understand this system I uploaded a presentation video on YouTube where everything was explained in detail.<br>
